        <h1 id="image_backupbat">IMAGE_BACKUP.BAT</h1>
<p>This batch file is meant to easily create a system image of the boot drive and all other essential partitions and data needed to successfully boot the computer.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>
This utility only backs up the partitions needed to boot the system.  In most situations, that is everything, but if the boot disk has been split or extra storage has been added (Drive D: for example), that drive will not be backed up.</p>
<h2 id="usage">USAGE</h2>
<ol>
<li>Plug in your backup media</li>
<li>Copy the image backup.bat file to the backup media drive</li>
<li>Open a command prompt as administrator on the backup media drive and execute the script image_backup.bat.</li>
</ol>

<p>In these examples, the backup drive is D: and the computername is LENOVO</p>
<h3 id="executes-wbadmin"><strong>Executes WBADMIN</strong></h3>
<p>Executes the WBADMIN utility to back up just drive C and essential boot partitions.  A directory <em>WindowsImageBackup\your_computername</em> is created on the backup drive
<code>wbadmin start backup -backupTarget:D: -include:C: -allCritical -quiet&quot;</code></p>
<h4 id="resets-permissions-on-windowsimagebackup"><strong>Resets permissions on WINDOWSIMAGEBACKUP</strong></h4>
<p>Since WBADMIN creates a directory on the backup drive which is protected, this script executes a few commands to unprotect the backup so it can be more easily viewed.<br>
<code>takeown /F D:\windowsimagebackup /a /r /d y &gt; nul </code><br>
<code>icacls D:\windowsimagebackup /reset /T &gt; nul</code></p>
<h4 id="exports-special-drivers-to-the-backup-directory"><strong>Exports special drivers to the backup directory</strong></h4>
<p>All special drivers not typically shipped with Windows are exported to <em>WindowsImageBackup\your_computername\Drivers</em><br>
<code>dism /online /export-driver /destination:D:\windowsimagebackup\LENOVO\Drivers</code></p>
<h4 id="if-it-exists-the-product-key-is-exported-as-well"><strong>If it exists, the product key is exported as well</strong></h4>
